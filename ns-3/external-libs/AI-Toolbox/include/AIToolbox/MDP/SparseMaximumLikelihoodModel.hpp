     * @brief This class models Experience as a Markov Decision Process using Maximum Likelihood.
     *
     * Often an MDP is not known in advance. It is known that it can assume
     * a certain set of states, and that a certain set of actions are
     * available to the agent, but not much more. Thus, in these cases, the
     * goal is not only to find out the best policy for the MDP we have,
     * but at the same time learn the actual transition and reward
     * functions of such a model. This task is called "reinforcement
     * learning".
     *
     * This class helps with this. A naive approach in reinforcement learning
     * is to keep track, for each action, of its results, and deduce transition
     * probabilities and rewards based on the data collected in such a way.
     * This class does just this, using Maximum Likelihood Estimates to decide
     * what the transition probabilities and rewards are.
     *
     * This class maps an Experience object to the most likely transition
     * reward functions that produced it. The transition function is guaranteed
     * to be a correct probability function, as in the sum of the probabilities
     * of all transitions from a particular state and a particular action is
     * always 1. Each instance is not directly synced with the supplied
     * Experience object. This is to avoid possible overheads, as the user can
     * optimize better depending on their use case. See sync().
     *
     * When little data is available, the deduced transition and reward
     * functions may be significantly subject to noise. A possible way to
     * improve on this is to artificially bias the data as to skew it towards
     * certain distributions.  This could be done if some knowledge of the
     * model (even approximate) is known, in order to speed up the learning
     * process. Another way is to assume that all transitions are possible, add
     * data to support that claim, and simply wait until the averages converge
     * to the true values.  Another thing that can be done is to associate with
     * each fake datapoint an high reward: this will skew the agent into trying
     * out new actions, thinking it will obtained the high rewards. This is
     * able to obtain automatically a good degree of exploration in the early
     * stages of an episode. Such a technique is called "optimistic
     * initialization".
     *
     * Whether any of these techniques work or not can definitely depend on
     * the model you are trying to approximate. Trying out things is good!
     *
     * The difference between this class and the MDP::MaximumLikelihoodModel
     * class is that this class stores transitions and rewards in sparse
     * matrices. This results in a possibly slower access to individual
     * probabilities and rewards, but immeasurably speeds up computation with
     * some classes of planning algorithms in case the number of useful
     * transitions is very small with respect to the total theoretic state
     * action space of SxAxS. It also of course incredibly reduces memory
     * consumption in such cases, which may also improve speed by effect of
     * improved caching.
